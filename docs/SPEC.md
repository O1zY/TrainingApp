# Training Tracker — spec

A personal training database and tracker: part "own Strava" (a feed of everything done),
part training tool (plan programmes, reuse sessions, analyse progress) across every sport.

## Decisions (agreed 23 Oct 2026)

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Platform | Web app, works equally well on phone and laptop |
| Sports | Everything: rowing (water + erg), running, cycling, strength/CrossFit, recovery/wellbeing, open to more |
| Core jobs | Plan programmes · Log sessions · Analyse progress · Session library |
| Data in | Manual logging + Strava import (no double entry) |
| Navigation | Dashboard home + tabs: Home · Plan · Log · Library · Analysis (Settings via gear) |
| Look | Auto light/dark following the device, with manual override |
| Units | User-selectable; default metric (km, kg). Rowing splits always /500m |
| Week | Starts Monday by default (setting) |
| Stack | React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4; Supabase for data/auth when the data sections start |
| Existing project | Deliberately ignored for now so it doesn't bias the design; linking is a late, separate section |

## Build sections (one per session)

1. **App shell + navigation** ✅ — layout, theme tokens, sidebar (laptop) / tab bar (phone), dashboard skeleton, settings
2. **Session logging** — fast entry per sport, sport-specific fields, RPE/notes
3. **Session library** — reusable workouts/templates, log-from-template
4. **Programme planner** — blocks → weeks → sessions, target races, schedule
5. **Analysis** — training load, PBs, planned vs completed, per-sport trends
6. **Strava import** — OAuth + activity sync, dedupe against manual logs
7. **Link to existing project** — scope decided at that point

## Conventions

- All colours come from tokens in `src/index.css` (`bg-surface`, `text-muted`, `bg-accent`, `text-sport-row`, …). Each discipline has its own colour token for logs, plans and charts.
- Shared UI pieces live in `src/components/ui.tsx`; nav items in `src/layout/nav.ts`.
- Settings are in `src/settings/SettingsContext.tsx` (localStorage until Supabase arrives).
